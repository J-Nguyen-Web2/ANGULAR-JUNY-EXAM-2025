    <h1>First Era</h1>

    <p>The term <strong>"first era"</strong> is derived from <em>The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria</em>. All events take place at an unknown time in the past but allegedly predate Morax's birth, which was over 6,000 years ago.</p>

    <p>400 years after the Heavenly Principles appeared — The Heavenly Principles finished preparing the world for humanity's arrival. They and Naberius created all animal life, and humanity creates a covenant with the Heavenly Principles. The Heavenly Principles creates a "sacred plan" for humanity, an era referred to as the "Ark's Opening." Humanity tends to the land, which flourishes, leading to a period known to the Enkanomiyans as the "Year of Jubilee."</p>

    <p>The Prayer artifact sets — Prayers to Springtime, Prayers for Illumination, Prayers for Destiny, and Prayers for Wisdom — describe a time when the earth was once covered by raw elements — unending ice, flames, lightning and water. Envoys of the gods made the earth more hospitable for humanity and dwelled among them, while humans could communicate with Celestia directly. The white Irminsul trees, connected to the ley lines in the earth, held great importance in the religious rituals of these ancient civilizations.</p>

    <p>Life during this era is described as one of abundance and seemingly endless prosperity, and divine envoys with direct connections to Celestia dwelled among humanity. The Four Shades are among the divine envoys. Once upon a time, the people of the land could hear revelations from Celestia directly. The envoys of the gods walked among benighted humanity then. In those days, life was weak, and the earth was blanketed in unending ice. The eternal ice had just begun to thaw, and the first fires were still new, the ancient flames were extinguished amidst the first falling rains, the waters ran dry as thunder first pierced the skies.</p>

    <p>The nature of the world Celestia created was cyclical; humanity would thrive and prosper under Celestia's blessings before coming to an end, and then the earth would be renewed, and the cycle would begin again. However, humanity was not meant to know this, so the heavenly envoys remained silent when people questioned how long their prosperity would last.</p>

    <p>To receive answers from Celestia, the people appointed chief priests who, wearing a crown made of Irminsul branches, would head to the depths of the world to attain enlightenment.</p>

    <p>Eventually, humanity grew prideful and ambitious and challenged the gods' authority. They sought to take the heavens for themselves and control their destinies, which angered Celestia and the heavenly envoys.</p>

    <p>Aria, Sonnet and Canon reside in the Lunar Palace, changing places three times a month to ride around the heavens in a silver carriage.</p>

    <p>Around this time existed the Angels (who would eventually turn into the Seelie), a race with beautiful, humanoid forms and great wisdom. They dwelled across the world and were tasked with guiding humanity. They built a large and prosperous civilization across the world and erected large palaces.</p>
